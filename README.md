# TestAutomationProject

● Developed a fully functional, organized, and robust framework from scratch using Java, Selenium
WebDriver, TestNG, Cucumber, ExtentReports, Maven, Jenkins, Page Objects Model and SQL.
● Automated all of the challenges on https://humanbenchmark.com/, writing time-efficient code with strong
logic to achieve top percentile scores on all challenges.
● Created a SQL database using MySQL, then used a JDBC connection to fetch the username and password
for the test account I used.
● Developed organized test suites for each section and an End-to-End regression suite.
● Configured CI/CD using Jenkins to execute the regression suite nightly and whenever new code is pushed.
● Created reusable methods for common actions (Click, Type, etc.) and utilized method overloading to ensure
flexible code
